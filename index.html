              <h2 class="display-4">Learning JS</h2>
              <p>I spent most of my time in this course learning the basics of JS. The first step is always the hardest and always takes the longest, however, once the basics are down, I was able to apply them to the next strand: Advanced JS - Natural Simulations. Natural Simulations allowed me to combine math, physics and computer programming. Learning this puts my foot in the door for some higher level programming experiences. </p>

              <p>The idea of teaching other people math concepts that I had only heard of and never seen, for example, complex numbers, was worrisome at first. Through this assignment, I was able to put together a presentation with my group, make my own version of the code, then explain to others how I did it. Not only was I able to get an understanding of complex numbers and the julia set overall, I was also able to use much more of Github to organize all my work, and start getting a better workflow than Khan Academy could ever offer. Learning Github now will let me go out in the real world and already have an understanding of the workflow. As a sidenote, you can click on the Julia set animation to view the associated repository in Github.</p>

              <h2 class="display-4">Other Languages Learned</h2>
              <p>Through this course, I ended up learning a few more languages than I thought I would. With the help from Khan Academy, I started with HTML and learned how to combine it with some CSS style elements. I then went on to learn Javascript. But there were two side products from this course that I did not expect to learn. With the Arduino’s, I learned C, which I picked up very quickly with my basic understanding of C++. Later on, I learned Java to code the Julia set. I did not seem to have any trouble picking up these two languages, even without the help from Khan Academy. </p>

              <p>This is my final year at AY, and soon, I will be moving on to studying whatever I want at university. This course has not only taught me a few new languages and some more math, it has also taught me how to get a proper workflow going, and made me appreciate having one. Khan Academy was frustrating at best, and having Processing and Github at my side, I won’t have to put up with another Khan crash again. I have applied to several computer science, software engineering, and network security  programs at various universities, and have been accepted to both network security programs, and currently waiting on the other programs. I am highly interested in Shopify and Cisco, so maybe that interest could take me somewhere...</p>
